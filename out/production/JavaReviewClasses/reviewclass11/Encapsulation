Encapsulation :
 Making the class fields private and creating  getter, setter methods
 Why we should care about Encapsulation:
  1) It provides privacy
  2)It provides security
How we can use Encapsulation :
 We make the class fields private and create methods to access
  and modify these fields.

  Rules for Setter Method:
  1)They should be public
  2)They have void as return type
  3)They should have parameter of same type as field

  Rules for Getter Methods :
  1)They should be public
  2)Their return type should be the same as fields return type
  3) They should not take any parameters
 class BankAccount{
    private String userName ;
    private String password;
    private double balance;

    public void setUsername (String userName){
    this.username=userName;
    }

    public void setPassword (String password){
        this.password=password;
        }

    public void setBalance (double balance){
         this.balance=balance;
         }

    public String getUserName(){
    return userName;
    }

     public String getPassword(){
        return password;
        }

     public String getPassword(){
             return password;
             }
