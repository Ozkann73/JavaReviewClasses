What is List in Java:
  1)It allows us to store duplicates.
  2)Insertion order is maintained.

ArrayList and LinkedList are the two most popular implementations of List interface.

ArrayList :
   When most of the operations are related to retrieval then we should use ArrayList

LinkedList :
   When most of the operations are related to manupilation (adding and deleting from
   anywhere inside the list) we use LinkedList.

===============================================================================
Set :
   Sets does not allow duplicate values.
 Most popular classes that have implemented Set interface.
  1) HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet
 HashSet :
  Upside : Insertion and retrieval is fastest of all sets
  DownSide: Insertion order is not maintained.
 LinkedHashSet :
   Upside : Insertion order is maintained
   DownSide : Insertion order is slower than HashSet but faster then TreeSet.
              Retrieval speed is the slowest of all. It goes through all nodes
 TreeSet :
   Upside : Stores the data in the sorted dorm
   DownSide : Insertion speed is the slowest of all
              Retrieval speed better than LinkedHashSet but slower than HashSet
==================================================================================
Maps :
  Map allows us to store key value pairs.
 1)HashMap  2) LinkedHAshMap  3)TreeMap

HashMap :
   Upside : fastest when it comes to insertion and retrieval
   DownSide : Insertion order is not maintained
LinkedHashMap:
   Upside : Insertion order is maintained
   DownSide : Insertion order is slower than HashMap but faster then TreeMap.
              Retrieval speed is the slowest of all. It goes through all nodes
